						<p>Recently my (now former) domain provider, freeavailabledomains.com which handles usa.cc second level domain names, had a rash of sites hosting malware from its service. This has lead to some antvirus and antimalware vendors such as Malwarebytes, <strong>automatically </strong>issuing a warning to the user and a report to the service provider for any usa.cc domain loaded into the browser, even with no actual malware involved.</p>
						<p>I was unaware of this and had been having an issue with my server&#39;s firewall configuration, and asked a friend to see if my site loaded for him. This resulted in his antivirus program reporting my site. <strong>My site that at the time had only static html, that can&#39;t possibly serve up any malware!</strong> My site was blocked by freeavailabledomains, and when I contacted them about it they had this to say: &quot;<em>We do not allow malware. Please use other service.</em>&quot;</p>
						<p><strong>Nobody even looked.</strong> As a result I no longer have any usa.cc domains</p>
