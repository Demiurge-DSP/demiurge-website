			<br>In the future costs could rise for various reasons such as but not limited to:
			<br>Domain name renewal typically costs more than the initial purchase price. (very likely to happen)
			<br>We may want to move to our own hardware and software at some point.
			<br>The future could hypothetically necessitate software upgrades we don't have the licenses for.
			<br>Hosting/connection would be needed if we were to move.
			<br>The electric bill could go up, especially if we were to move.
			<br>
			<br>We would aim to run cheaply rather than pander for donations.
