			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			What does Demiurge have for the exp rate, movement speed, and other settings?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			See <a href="https://github.com/Demiurge-DSP/feedback-and-info/wiki/Basic-Server-Info">this page.</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			What are the server rules?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			TL;DR - Don't be a jerk, don't try to cheat. Don't give attitude to the Admin or GMs. Don't act like you are owed something because you contributed.<br>
			A more detailed page will be linked here soon.<!-- See <a href="http://www.demiurge.pw/Rules">this page for actual details.</a> -->
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			There is a question I think should be here. How can we get it added?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			Suggest it on our <a href="https://discord.gg/SSU3HMq">Discord</a>, or on our <a href="https://github.com/Demiurge-DSP/feedback-and-info">github tracker</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			I want to contribute. How do I write code for Demiurge?
			<br>
			<b>Answer from Teo:</b><br>
			Fork Darkstar on github and pull request your changes to Contribute directly to the master branch. Anything that makes it into Darkstar will automatically become part of the code Demiurge uses. The folks at Darkstar can help you with your pull request. I'm part of Darkstar as well, so you will likely see me there.<br>
			Requirements include knowledge of or a willingness to learn git features such as pull, commit, push, stash, rebase...And a lot of patience.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			Are you same Teo in all those commits in Darkstar's git history?
			<br>
			<b>Answer from Teo:</b><br>
			Why yes, yes I am! Don't let this fool you into thinking I am so kind of magical unicorn coding deity though, most of what I do could be done by any experienced monkey.<br>
			But I vow that all my work is sent to Darkstar if it properly matches retail in a maintainable manner. None of that <i>"The only server with working thing"</i> here! /humblebrag.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			Do you take donations? Will I get anything for donating?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			Demiurge does not take any real world money in any countries currency.<br>
			If you want to give Teo imaginary Internet money you can get for free though, you can do that. You will get absolutely nothing for it.<br>
			Litecoin - <b>LTgLGzX7KYVtMKbZtX4gikJYJT11TPXdkW</b><br>
			Bitcoin - <b>1BadFLjwqxjAyLj8B4gVM2JW53BDxyHBQU</b><br>
			<b>You can also give <a href="https://coinpot.co/mine/litecoin/?ref=50331B7C7397">spare CPU clock cycles</a> instead.</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			Whats it costing to run Demiurge anyway?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			In terms of money, not much. See <a href="http://www.demiurge.pw/Operating-Costs.html">this page.</a> The main "expense" is time and thought.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			Whats happens to our characters if you decide to stop running the game?
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			Character exports would be a thing and/or the database would be handed off to someone (likely multiple someones for redundancy).
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			Is this server run by the same people that ran LD (LegionDark)?
			<br>
			<b>Answer from Teo:</b><br>
			No. I was helping LD a lot, had GM status, and often posted announcements for LD. You might have known me as Batman or Sarda as well. I helped some other servers to but was rarely if ever in game or otherwise noticable.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Question:</b><br>
			I've seen your work Teo, and would like to discuss a job offer that does not involve FFXI private servers at all and is definitely not an unpaid internship!
			<br>
			<b>Answer:</b><br>
			I'd be happy to talk to you as soon as possible! Tag me on <a href="https://discord.gg/SSU3HMq">Discord</a> and I'll message you my contact info / send you my resume.
